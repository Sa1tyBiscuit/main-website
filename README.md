## How to contribute? ⭐ 

Before making any contributions, please take a look at our [Community Guidelines](https://yfosp.netlify.app/community-guidelines) and take a look at the [existing Issues](https://github.com/Your-First-Open-Source-Project/main-website/issues) or create a [new issue](https://github.com/Your-First-Open-Source-Project/main-website/issues/new)!

Wanna make a contribution but don't know how? Please follow the steps below.

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and create a Git (not GitHub) account

   * Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code
   * Type `git --version` in a directory of your choice - you should see the version of Git that you downloaded. If you see an error, close and reopen VS Code and try again
   * Set your user name with 
   `git config --global user.name "<your-first-name> <your-last-name>"` - replace the `<placeholders>` with the real values
   * Set your email address with 
   `git config --global user.email "<your-email-here>"`- replace the `<placeholder>` with the real values (your email address should match the one with which you signed up for your GitHub account)

2.  Fork this repository. This will create a copy of this repo in your GitHub account:
    * Open [Your-First-Open-Source-Project/main-website](https://github.com/Your-First-Open-Source-Project/main-website) (this repository)
    * Select **Fork** and  * Make a [Fork](https://github.com/Your-First-Open-Source-Project/main-website/fork) --> The URL of your fork is now `https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT>/main-website`

3. Clone the repository

4. Make changes 

5. Commit and push your changes to your fork
    * type `git add .` (yes, there is a space (` `) between `add` and the `.`) - this adds all changes to staging area
    * type `git commit -m "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"` - this will commit your changes with the messages
    * type `git push` to push the changes to your remote fork
